# Playing Cards

This small mod adds enchanted playing cards as collectible items.

Each card provides its own unique effect when carried in your character's inventory. The card's description alludes to its effect.

Each card comes in two varieties: worn and pristine. Worn cards have roughly half the effect of their pristine counterparts. Worn cards cannot be repaired. Effects of both variants are not exclusive, i.e. worn cards' effects stack with pristine ones'.

While it would be ideal to have each card spawn only once, card spawns are not limited. As such, you may encounter multiple copies of the same card. Effects from most, though not all, cards stack with those of their copies.

This version of the mod is intended for the **0.H** stable release.

## Status

The mod is **complete**. It may or may not receive feature updates with future stable releases.

You may also find a version of this mod for the [experimental](https://github.com/FrontierModsExtra/PlayingCards/tree/experimental) branch of the game. This version receives support to make it compatible with the latest experimental version. It does not receive feature updates.
